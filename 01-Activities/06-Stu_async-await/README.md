# 🏗️ Refactor the Code to Use `async` and `await` Instead of Promises Chains

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a business owner, I want to update my application's code to keep up with modern practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when `singleRepo.ts` no longer uses Promise chaining and instead uses `async` and `await`.

* It's done when the application functions as before with the refactored code.

## 💡 Hint

* How does JavaScript know when a function is asynchronous?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a `try/catch` block?
