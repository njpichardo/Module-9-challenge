# 🏗️ Implement Express.js Routing

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to receive HTML content when I visit specific URLs.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I've created an `app` variable set to the value of `express()`.

* It's done when I've set up middleware to serve static files from `/public`.

* It's done when I've created an HTML route to serve up `paths.html`.

## 💡 Hints

What is the `path` module used for when defining routes?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a PORT? Can you find some additional examples of applications that use specific PORTs while in use?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
