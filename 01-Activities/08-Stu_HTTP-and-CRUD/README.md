# 🐛 Edit and Delete Buttons Do Not Update Items in a List

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a manager, I should be able to update and delete users from a list.

## Expected Behavior

  * When a user submits the displayed form, the `User` is updated, and a success message is rendered on the page.

* When a user inputs an ID and clicks the "Delete User" button, the matching `User` is removed.

## Actual Behavior

* When a user searches for an ID, nothing happens.

* When a user clicks the "Delete" button next to an item, nothing happens.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

2. Input a user ID in the "DELETE Data" card and click the "Delete User" button next to an item.
