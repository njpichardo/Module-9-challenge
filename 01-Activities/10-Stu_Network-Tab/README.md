# 📖 Implement a Redirect if Response Status is `404`

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a business owner, I want my application to redirect to a new page if an error occurs, so that users are notified of any issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I make a `fetch()` request that results in a 404 status and the browser redirects to `404.html`.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [MDN Web Docs on `location.replace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/replace)

## 💡 Hints

* How can the Network Activity tab assist us?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between `document.location.assign` and `document.location.replace`?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
