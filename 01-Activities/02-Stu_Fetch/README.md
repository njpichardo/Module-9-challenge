# 🏗️ Implement the Fetch API to Display GitHub Data as HTML

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a manager, I want an app that calls the GitHub API so that I can print a list of my team's GitHub usernames and links to their profiles.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I press the "Click Me" button, and a list of five GitHub users appears on the page underneath the button.

* It's done when each user includes their login name and a URL to their GitHub profile.

* It's done when I click on a user, and a new tab opens to their GitHub profile.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are fetch options used for?

* What `tsconfig` options did Vite create? Are there options that you've used in the past that are missing?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
