# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of Path Parameters and Query Parameters

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/server.ts).

---

## 📝 Notes

* How are path parameters denoted when building route paths?

* How can we chain multiple query parameters together?

* Does the order of query parameters matter?

Refer to the documentation:

* [Express.js documentation on route paths](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-paths)

* [Express.js documentation on req.query](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* When would you use query string parameters vs. route parameters?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
