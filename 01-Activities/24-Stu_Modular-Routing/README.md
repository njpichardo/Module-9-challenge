# 🐛 Modular Routes Not Resolving Successfully

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue: 

* As a user, I should be able to make both GET and POST requests to `/api/tips`.

## Expected Behavior

When a user makes a GET or POST request to `/api/tips`, the request should complete successfully.

## Actual Behavior

When a user makes a GET or POST request to `/api/tips`, the request fails.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the routes in `src/routes/api/tips.ts` are properly used in the application.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [Express.js documentation on express.Router](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router)

## 💡 Hints

The feedback routes are successfully working. Use those routes to help guide you.  

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we modularize the HTML/view routes to declutter the `server.ts` and better organize the file/folder structure?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
