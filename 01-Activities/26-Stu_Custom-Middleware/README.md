# 📖 Implement Logging Middleware 

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a user, I want to log all incoming requests so that I can more easily debug my application.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I've created a custom middleware function to log both the URLs and the methods of incoming requests.

* It's done when my custom middleware function follows the separation of concerns principles and is exported for use in other files.

* It's done when I've imported my custom middleware function into my `server.ts` file.

* It's done when I've added my custom middleware function to run for all routes.
