# 🏗️ Create an API Route

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to receive data back when I make a request to an API route.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I've imported Express.js into my project.

* It's done when I've created an `app` variable set to the value of `express()`.

* It's done when I've created an API route to `/api/`.

* It's done when GET requests made using the browser to the API endpoint return the content found in `terms.json`.

## 💡 Hints

Which method can we use on the `res` object that will allow us to send JSON to the client?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you've completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other properties and methods are available on the Express request and response parameters?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
